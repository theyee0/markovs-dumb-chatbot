.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
[OPTION]...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Create a simple markov chain based text prediction model based on files specified
in the input parameters.
.Pp
There are two basic modes of operation: training mode and inference mode. Training mode
takes a list of input files and an output model name, then creates a model to represent
the word transitions in the input files. Inference mode uses a model file to complete
a user-specified prompt.
.Pp
All parameters, even required ones like the model, must be explicitly stated in the
command line with flags.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl h
Displays quick help and exits.
.It Fl t Ar file1[,file2,file3,...]
Specifies a comma-delimited list of training file names.
.It Fl m Ar filename
Specifies a file for the Markov Chain's model. Required for all invocations.
.It Fl n Ar num
Restricts the amount of content generated by the model to
.Ar num
words.
.It Fl v Ar filename
Specifies a file containing a newline or space separated list of vocabulary words.
.It Fl p Ar prompt
In Inference mode, specifies a prompt that will be completed by the model.

.Sh EXAMPLES
.Pp
Examples provided below use the generic model "model.txt" and generic training files:
.Pp
Train a file with a single input file:
.Dl ./markovs_dumb_chatbot -m model.txt -t file.txt
Train a file with multiple inputs:
.Dl ./markovs_dumb_chatbot -m model.txt -t file1.txt,file2.txt,file3.txt
Train a file with a supplementary vocabulary:
.Dl ./markovs_dumb_chatbot -m model.txt -t file.txt -v vocab.txt
Autocomplete a prompt with the default word count:
.Dl ./markovs_dumb_chatbot -m model.txt -p prompt
Autocomplete a prompt with a specific number of words:
.Dl ./markovs_dumb_chatbot -m model.txt -p prompt -n 42
